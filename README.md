## **Drunk Text Generator**

**What is it?**

This Lua script generates a "drunk" version of your text, adding random fillers and duplicating letters for a humorous, intoxicated effect.

**How does it work?**

1. **Input:** You provide a text string.
2. **Level:** You set a "level" that controls the intensity of the drunk effect. Higher levels result in more pronounced drunkenness.
3. **Filler Texts:** A list of filler texts (e.g., "...", "blu-b", "--") is used to randomly insert into the original text.
4. **Letter Duplication:** Letters are duplicated randomly, adding to the chaotic appearance.

**Usage:**

1. **Include the script:** Place the script in your Lua project.
2. **Call the function:** Use `applyDrunkEffect(text, level)` to apply the effect.
3. **Customize:** Adjust the `fillerTexts` array to change the fillers used.

**Example:**

```lua
local drunkText = applyDrunkEffect("Hello, world!", 5)
print(drunkText) -- Output might be something like: "H-e-l-l-l-l-o, w-o-r-l-d!... blu-b"
```

**Parameters:**

- **myText:** The input text string.
- **currentLevel:** The current level of drunkenness (1-10).
- **maxLevel:** The maximum possible level (1-10).

**Return Value:**

The function returns the modified, "drunk" text string.

**Additional Notes:**

- The script is designed for Luau.
- You can adjust the `maxLevel` and `fillerTexts` to customize the effect.
- For more advanced usage, consider creating a module script.

**Enjoy your drunken text adventures!**
